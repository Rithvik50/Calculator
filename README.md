# Calculator
This is a Calculator I created using Java(implemented with PEMDAS evaluation) back in the summer of 2019. It utilizes ArrayLists and important concepts like prefixing and postfixing
to create the PEMDAS operation. My project implements GUI to create a Calculator display in which you can input numbers and operators. The answer will be displayed on the GUI calculator display.
